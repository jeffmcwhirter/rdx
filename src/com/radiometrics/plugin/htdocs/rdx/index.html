<h2>RAMADDA Introduction</h2>
RAMADDA comes with extensive <a href="https://geodesystems.com/repository/userguide/toc.html#index.html">documentation</a>. 

A brief summary of the Radiometrics instrument monitoring facility -
<ul>
  <li> The content within RAMADDA is defined as a hierarchical collection of  entries. 
  <li> Entries can be of any number of types, e.g., a folder, a simple file, a wiki page, etc.
  <li> When viewing an entry (e.g., a folder, an instrument collection, a radiometer) there are a number of
    functions that are accessed via its <img src=${root}/icons/entrymenu.png width=24> menu link. These functions include editing, creating new entries, access control and delete.
  <li> The Radiometrics RAMADDA provides special purpose entry types - RDX Collection, RDX Radiometer, RDX Wind Profilder, etc
  <li> To create a new collection or instrument entry navigate to the desired parent entry, click on its menu. There should be a "New RDX Collection" or "New RDX Radiometer" link. If not, choose  "Pick a Type" and look for the desired entry type.

  <li> RDX Instrument Collections

  <ul>
    <li> A RDX Instrument Collection entry holds any number of instrument entries and provide a predefined view of their instruments
    <li> There can be any number of collection entries and they can used to organize instrument information in different ways. For example, one RDX collection can hold all of the production instruments while another collection can be used for test purposes.
  </ul>

  <li> RDX Instruments
  <ul>
    <li> When adding a new instrument (e.g,, radiometer, wind profiler, sodar) the <i>instrument id</i> is used
    to key the RAMADDA instrument entry with the instrument status in the external database.
    <li> RAMADDA  instrument entries can be created that do not have a corresponding instrument in the external database. 
    <li> The instrument monitoring and notification process can be turned off for a particular instrument. 
    <li> The fields - Last Network Connection, Last Data Connection and Last LDM Connection are set from the notification process. All other fields can be edited through RAMADDA.
  </ul>

  <li> View and edit access can be controlled to certain users. More information <a href="https://geodesystems.com/repository/userguide/access.html">here</a>.

  <li> A single entry or a tree of entries (e.g., a collection) can be exported (through the entry's menu Export link). This is a self-contained zip file that can then be imported under a different entry or into a different RAMADDA repository. For example, one can create an instrument collection on a development RAMADDA then import that collection into a production RAMADDA.

</ul>


<h2>Specifying Notifications</h2>
Notifications are specified using RAMADDA's entry properties  system. To add a new notification for an instrument collection -
<ul>
  <li> Navigate to the collection entry
  <li> Click on the <img src=${root}/icons/entrymenu.png width=24> menu button
  <li> There should be an Add Notification link
  <li> Enter the appropriate information. 
  <li> <b>Note: Be sure to check on the "Inherited" field</b>
  <li> You can have any number of notifications for a collection
  <li> To edit an existing notification go to the Edit Properties link from the entry popup menu. Edit the notification and press "Change".
 <li> To delete an existing notification go to the Edit Properties link from the entry popup menu.  Click on "Select" and press "Delete selected"
</ul>


<h2>Viewing Instrument Status and Pending Notifications</h2>

There are 2 top-level entry points for viewing the external instrument database and the internal list of pending notifications:
<ul>
<li> <a href="${root}/rdx/instruments">${root}/rdx/instruments</a>
<li> <a href="${root}/rdx/notifications">${root}/rdx/notifications</a>
</ul>
From the above pages you can also turn off/on the instrument monitoring and notification process.

<p>

<h2>Creating Alternative Views</h2>
A number of standard views of instrument information have been provided, e.g. - tables, bar charts, maps, etc. 
However, it is easy to create new views with RAMADDA's wiki facility. The best way to do this is to copy (using the
<img src=${root}/icons/entrymenu.png width=24> copy link) one of the existing extra wiki pages. Once copied go 
to its edit page to view and change the wiki text. The wiki facility is fully documented
<a href="https://geodesystems.com/repository/userguide/page_ramaddawikifacilities.html">here</a>.


The standard view for collection and instrument entries is defined within the rdxtypes.xml file
contained in the source release and distributed within the rdxplugin.jar. This standard view can
be changed in the plugin.
